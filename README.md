Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find solutions to problems from LeetCode and HackerRank, implemented in Java, C, and Python. These solutions are structured and optimized for learning and reference. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or improving your problem-solving skills, this repository has something for you!

Important Note -->
The solutions provided in this repository may require slight modifications to run directly on LeetCode:
    Print Statements: Remove the additional text within print functions for compatibility.
    Static Keyword: Remove the static keyword from functions (except main) as LeetCode expects non-static methods in its test environment.
